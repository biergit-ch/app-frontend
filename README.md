# Biergit app-frontend

## Introduction

*Frontend of the **biergit** app*

## Setup

1. Install the latest version of [Yarn]
2. Run the build or development server commands listed below

[yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com

## Commands

### Development Server

`yarn dev` builds the frontend and starts a development server (on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) by default).
When files change, they are rebuilt and the browser is reloaded.

### Build

`yarn build` builds to frontend and stores the build artifacts in the `.next` directory. The contents of this directory are cleared before every build. 

### Lint

`yarn type-check` runs TSLint over all source files for code style checking.

## About
